# open-playing-cards
A set of open-source playing cards that you can use for anything you want.

## Currently Available Sets
- Plain (located at `plain/`), all black, with just a letter or number and no suit.

## What can I do with these?
__Anything.__ Literally. You don't even have to credit us to use them. We provide every card as an SVG, and we provide the project files used to make them (which are usually Vectornator files, see [vectornator.io](https://www.vectornator.io)).

But hey, if you'd like to credit us, that would be cool.
